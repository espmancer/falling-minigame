# falling-minigame
Practice project for when I want to work on my bigger game ideas. This was all I wrote for the idea: 
```
You are falling
You can move left or right 
You can rotate left or right
There are obstacles you have to dodge
If you hit an obstacle you lose
```
## Planned Code Structure
- `Player` class that inherits from Sprite which represents the Player's attributes
- `Obstacle` class that inherits from Sprite which represents the Obstacle's attributes
- `EventHandler` class that handles the events
